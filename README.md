# LinkedIn Auto Poster

Automatically generate and schedule engaging LinkedIn posts using Gemini AI, with Telegram review and approval.

## Features
- Generates highly detailed, educational, and engaging LinkedIn posts using Gemini
- Schedules posts at 6:00 AM, 12:30 PM, and 7:00 PM daily (cron jobs)
- Sends post content to Telegram for manual review/approval
- Posts to LinkedIn only after Telegram approval
- Easy to deploy locally or on cloud platforms (e.g., Render)

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd linkedin-auto-poster
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following:
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token
TELEGRAM_USER_ID=your_telegram_user_id
LINKEDIN_EMAIL=your_linkedin_email
LINKEDIN_PASSWORD=your_linkedin_password
```

### 4. Start the services (locally)
Open two terminals:
```bash
# Terminal 1: Scheduler (generates and sends posts to Telegram)
npm start

# Terminal 2: Telegram Listener (handles /approve and /skip)
npm run listen
```

## Cloud Deployment (e.g., Render)
- Create **two background worker services** from the same repo:
  - Service 1: `npm start`
  - Service 2: `npm run listen`
- Set the same environment variables for both services in the dashboard.
- (Optional) Set `TZ` env variable if you want a specific timezone.

## Usage
- At each scheduled time, a post is generated and sent to your Telegram.
- Reply `/approve` to post to LinkedIn, or `/skip` to ignore.

## Notes
- All AI content is generated by Gemini (Google AI).
- No images are generated (text-only posts).
- For production, consider using a database or cloud storage for shared state if running on multiple services.
